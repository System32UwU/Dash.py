# Dash.py

Dash.py is my platformer game that I've started developing recently. Hope you'll like it!

Prerequisites are Git, Python, and Pygame. The former two should be installed by default on most Linux systems.

To install Git on Windows:

Do "winget install -e --id Git.Git" in CMD.

To install Python on Windows:

Go into Microsoft Store, search for Python, and install the latest version of Python.

To install Pygame:

Do "pip install pygame" in your terminal/CMD.

Installation guide:

Do "git clone https://github.com/System32UwU/Dash.py/" (without quotes) in your terminal.

In order to launch the game, either navigate to the game's folder and click "start.bat" (Windows only), or do "python dash.py" in your terminal/CMD.
