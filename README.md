# Dash.py

Dash.py is my platformer game that I've started developing recently. Hope you'll like it!

Prerequisites are Git, Python, and Pygame. The former two should be installed by default on most Linux systems.

# To install Git on Windows:

Do "winget install -e --id Git.Git" in CMD.

# To install Python on Windows:

Go into Microsoft Store, search for Python, and install the latest version of Python.

# To install Pygame:

Do "pip install pygame" in your terminal/CMD.

# Installation guide:

Do "git clone https://github.com/System32UwU/Dash.py/" (without quotes) in your terminal.

In order to launch the game, either navigate to the game's folder and click "start.bat" (Windows only), or do "python dash.py" in your terminal/CMD.
